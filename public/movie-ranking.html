<h2>My top 3 movies all-time</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Perfect Days</h3>

    <p>This film most comforting and relax film that I watch in a while. Lead actor Koji Yakusho is my fovorite japanese <br>
    male actor. Film telling the storie of a toilet cleaning workers life. He has a rotine he follows every day. He has a <br>
    simple life but he is peacful. Film originally produce for Tokyo's toilet puclic realition. </p>

<h3>Shutter Island</h3>

    <p>Movie is about a U.S. Marshal who goes to an isolated hospital for the criminally insane to investigate the <br>
    disappearance of a patient who is a multiple murderer. Dicaprio's fantastic acting, movie twists and movie musics <br>
    make the film great. The ending is confusing for most viewers that include myself. But over all its 5 stars.</p>

<h3>Fight Club</h3>

        <p> Fight Club is maybe my most favorite movie all-time. I didnt count how many times I wacth this movie. I even <br>
        read the book. Movie's senario excally like the book. They are same. I also know almost every line in the movie.</p>
